# rainbow-hat-js

A NodeJS library, that's been translated from the official Python library [here](https://github.com/pimoroni/rainbow-hat).

Tested with Raspberry Pi 3 only. Currently only `touch`, `rainbow`, `lights` and `display` work and it is still work-in-progress. Also `display` might cause SIGSEGVs and `touch` will kill your IRQ #79 at first.
